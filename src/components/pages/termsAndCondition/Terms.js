            to conduct and manage Virtual Purchases in the Services, such
            Virtual Purchases will be done and managed using blockchain
            technology. When you use GMRE to conduct a transaction, your GameRee
            account becomes publicly available. We shall have no knowledge of or
            control over Virtual Purchases made between users, and we will be
            unable to reverse any such transactions. As a result, we will not be
            liable to you or any third parties for any claims or damages arising
            out of Virtual Purchases.

            these links are provided only for the convenience of our users. We
            have no control over the contents of those websites or resources,

          <h5>24/7 Provision of Services not Guaranteed</h5>
          <p>
            Although we strive to keep the Services available at all times in
            the future, there may be situations when we must temporarily or
            permanently shut the Site. Without prior warning or liability, the
            Services may be changed, updated, stopped, suspended, or cancelled
            at any time. Keep in mind that the Company will not be liable if the
            Services, in whole or in part, are unavailable at any time or for
            any amount of time. We may also restrict access to any portions of
            the Services, or the entire Services, to users, including registered
            users, from time to time. We cannot and do not make any warranties
            or representations about the devices you use to access or use the

          <h5>Law that governs.</h5>

          <h5>Terms and Conditions.</h5>
          <p>
            These Terms are the only and final agreement between you and Company
            about the Services, and they replace any and all prior and
            contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and
            warranties, whether written and oral, regarding the Services.
            Company's waiver of any term or condition of these Terms will not be
            construed as a further or continuing waiver of that term or
            condition or any other term or condition, and Company's failure to
            assert any right or provision under these Terms will not be
            construed as a waiver of that right or provision. If any provision
            of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by
            a court of competent jurisdiction for any reason, that provision
            will be modified to reflect the parties' intention or eliminated to
            the extent necessary so that the remaining provisions of the Terms
            will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign, transfer,
            or sublicense the Terms or any rights or obligations hereunder
            without Company's prior written agreement, but we may assign or
            transfer the Terms or any rights or obligations hereunder without
            limitation. Any attempted assignment by you will be invalid due to a
            violation of these Terms. The section headings in the Terms are just
            for reference and have no legal or contractual significance.
